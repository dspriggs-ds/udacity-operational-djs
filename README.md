This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, our goal is determine the next set of potential customers to which to market. To accomplish this task we are we are building a model then create consumable pipelines. We will use the power of Azure AutoML functionality to determine the potential customer by submitting a data set and AutoML will provide the best model and a consumable endpoint; in this case will use a python script to submit test data and retrieve results from the best model selected.
